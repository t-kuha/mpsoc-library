# This file was generated by CMake because it detected TRY_RUN() commands

# Copy it to a safe location, set the variables to appropriate values

# COMPILER_WORKS_EXITCODE
#    indicates whether the executable would have been able to run on its
#    target platform. If so, set COMPILER_WORKS_EXITCODE to
#    the exit code (in many cases 0 for success), otherwise enter "FAILED_TO_RUN".
# COMPILER_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT
#    contains the text the executable would have printed on stdout and stderr.
#    If the executable would not have been able to run, set COMPILER_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT empty.
#    Otherwise check if the output is evaluated by the calling CMake code. If so,
#    check what the source file would have printed when called with the given arguments.
# The COMPILER_WORKS_COMPILED variable holds the build result for this TRY_RUN().
